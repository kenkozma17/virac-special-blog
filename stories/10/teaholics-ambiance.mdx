Despite feeling flustered as the sudden sheerline rain approached the bay and eventually enveloped us, meeting Ms. Miguela Aguilar, the owner of Teaholic, was a fleeting yet remarkable moment. In the midst of the downpour, she seemed to share our state of mind, gracefully walking into a dry, calm, and quiet setting, immersing herself in the Zen atmosphere.

According to Ms. Miguela, the dream of owning a tea-focused establishment had been brewing within her for years. Despite contrary opinions from her parents, she decided to bring her dream to life with Teaholic. Years of observing and managing El Jose bar at Metro Walk allowed her to witness the gradual transition in the market, with an increasing preference for tea-based beverages. Encouraged by this trend, she finally decided to pursue her original plans and turn Teaholic into a reality.
