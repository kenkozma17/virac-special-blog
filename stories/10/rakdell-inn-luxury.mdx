Perched gracefully in the heart of Virac, Rakdell Inn stands as a symbol of resilience, adaptation, and enduring hospitality. This sophisticated four-story structure, home to 40 fully furnished rooms and a suite of exquisite services, not only withstood the test of time but also emerged as a stronger, more refined haven deeply intertwined with the local community.

Ms. Jai Garcia Del Valle, a steadfast member of the Rakdell team for fourteen years, shared insights into the Inn's remarkable journey. From her early days as a front desk receptionist to her current role as an Admin officer, Ms. Del Valle has been an integral part of Rakdell's success story. In a brief conversation, she shed light on the efforts undertaken over the past year or two â€“ a period marked by rebuilding, reconstruction, and strategic liaisons to navigate the economic challenges that followed the island's lockdown.

This addition encourages guests to indulge in a relaxing and tranquil atmosphere near the beach.
