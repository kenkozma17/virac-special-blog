In the year 2021, a culinary revolution dawned on Catanduanes as Z-Mart emerged as the pioneer of the Korean Convenience Store on the small island. What makes this venture unique? It's not just a business; it's a family-owned endeavor with no Korean heritage or relatives in Korea. Instead, it's a venture born out of a pure fascination with food, a love for culture, and the undeniable influence of Korean culture.

The story of Z-Mart is one of passion, curiosity, and a commitment to enriching the local community. Despite being situated on a small island, the owners aim to transcend geographical boundaries by introducing a diverse array of foreign products and cuisines to their fellow Catandunganons. For them, it's not just about running a store; it's about bringing the Korean world closer to the shores of their beloved island.

In the heart of Catanduanes, Z-Mart stands as a testament to the belief that culinary experiences should know no bounds. It's an ambitious endeavor that seeks to create an immersive experience for locals, a place where the global meets the local in a harmonious fusion of flavors and cultures.
