The journey of Impling's Latik, however, wasn't always a smooth one. According to online articles and YouTube stories, Chef Impling, also known as Mr. Simplico Mendoza, ventured into this culinary pursuit 25 years ago. The path to perfection involved several consecutive flops before discovering the ultimate recipe. With a small team and a commitment to meeting demand, Chef Impling turned his dream into a reality, reaping the rewards of his dedication over the years.

Reflecting on his journey, Chef Impling shares, "You should know where you are heading, and above all, you must have faith in God." These guiding principles have not only led him to success but also allowed him to provide for his family and the dedicated individuals working alongside him.

Today, the legacy lives on through Chef Impling's son, Mark Mikko Mendoza, the proud owner and a teacher at Catanduanes National High School. Mark Mikko continues the commitment to excellence, preserving the same cherished recipe that has become a symbol of Catanduanes' culinary identity.
