In the heart of San Pablo along the Boulevard’s series of dining places, Alley Avenue, formerly known as Alley Cafe, opened its doors to a new neighborhood with a grand ceremony last September. The move brought about a shift in atmosphere, trading the cozy interior for an inviting al fresco setting. Despite the change in dining exposure, patrons and friends responded warmly to the call, ensuring that Alley Avenue seamlessly picked up where Alley Cafe left off.

While the distance may be inconsequential, the transition to an outdoor Al fresco experience brings a breath of fresh air to Alley Avenue. The menu retains its charm, featuring a delightful array of pasta, comfort dishes, and a plethora of sweets catering to the young at heart. Patrons can also indulge in innovative and refreshing beverages, regularly showcased on their engaging Facebook page.

Alley Avenue has become a hub for a diverse circle of patrons and friends, including photographers, event organizers, suppliers, and students. In the ever-evolving landscape of the food and beverage industry, Alley Avenue maintains an active approach, constantly introducing innovative themes that resonate with the rhythm of the town's transitions. A notable favorite is the all-day/all-night "Swiftie" event, dedicated to enjoying Taylor Swift's music while dining on the porch.
