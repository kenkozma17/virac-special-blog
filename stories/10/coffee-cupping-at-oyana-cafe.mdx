A 25 year old creased map of the world, notes I took from the night before and the crisp delicate sunray shining through the porch. It was a warm and sunny morning and we were attending a coffee cupping at Oyana Café. I have never been to one and this was my first. For those that have no idea what it is, it’s a term used to identify a way of tasting and experiencing coffee.

Making it to the porch slightly after 8am, I was caught in awe, to see the layout on the long table, noticing a couple of scales, some deep blue dishes with coffee beans, ceramic cups and charts. As awkward as I felt, I pulled out my own pile of material from my bag and got settled in. To strike an adequate conversation and not sound ignorant on the subject, I asked them a few questions from what I learned the night before about the history of Coffee. Here I was amongst the baristas of the café and two esteemed owners, Mr Blandy Terrobias and Ms Diana Terrobias.

The moment arrived; we were introduced to the process and the subject, from the use of correct temperature, evident weight, charts and coffee beans on the table. We had Ethiopia Yirgacheffe G1 Misty Valley, Brazil Santos, Sablan Benguet and Mt. Apo Davao. The weight, temperature and duration of preparing were emphasized for the process and Mr Terrobias articulated that often enough. We repeatedly discussed and made comparison with their fragrance, acidity, flavor and uniformity. Having the chance to slurp each coffee may have been the finest, as we finally got to taste all of them with our assigned spoon.

According to the couple, there are organizations worldwide that periodically gather, engage in numerous cupping and Specialty Coffee Association is one amongst them. Having done this morning’s photo shoot for our feature, was a wonderful experience. Though in real context it was educational, it was the essence of smell and taste that played more significantly. The aroma briefly brought me fragments of flashback from distant places and time, while the tasting process itself brought me back to my present day self. It was a beautiful journey on stretched cobblestone in Vienna, standing near my neighborhood bakery in Jeddah, seeing the lights at the night bazaar stalls in Morocco.
