In a three-day spectacle of familiarization, practice, and heart-wrenching challenges, 18 skilled baristas graced the stage for the first-ever Coffee Brewdown on October 25, 2023. Hailing from cafes as far away as Bato and San Andres, these baristas showcased their masterful skills, transforming the event into a lively celebration of the island's coffee culture.

The coveted Championship title was claimed by John Abension of Rojazz Cafe, while the first runner-up position went to Anabelle of Alley Avenue. The rigorous competition was expertly judged by Marion Briz, Blandy Terrobias, and Sam Tagam, ensuring each brew reached the pinnacle of excellence that memorable morning.

How do we encapsulate the essence of coffee? Is it in the first brew, the rich aroma of the chosen coffee blend, a velvety cappuccino, or perhaps the moment a barista places that steaming cup on your table? These elements played a vital role in shaping the unique experience of the Island Brewdown, the first-ever of its kind on the island. As we savor the aromas, flavors, and grades, we recognize that our journey into the world of coffee has just begun. Join us on this exploration, and anticipate the return of this exciting event next year.

Appreciating the smell, taste, and grade is merely the beginning of this coffee adventure and this event hopefully will be the first of many to come.
