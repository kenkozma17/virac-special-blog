As the well-known November breeze rustles along the boulevard, signaling the arrival of the island's annual rain and grey-skied season, we find ourselves revisiting Oyana Cafe. With a reasonable amount of time passing since our last feature in February 2022, we once again bring you the latest from Ms. Diana and Mr. Blandy in this issue of Virac Special.

In this gloomy and chilled November, Oyana Cafe unveils a selection of new dishes set to grace their menu before the year draws to a close. Ms. Diana and Mr. Blandy introduce us to the delights of hummus and green salads, each offering a unique flavor profile. Hummus, a popular dip in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine, takes on an authentic form in this island cafe—a delightful novelty. The tossed green salad, with its light and satisfying zest, is a definite must-try for your next visit. While we may not be at a luxurious hotel, Oyana Cafe lets us capture a unique culinary experience much reminiscent of one.
