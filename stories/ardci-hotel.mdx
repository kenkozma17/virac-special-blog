ARDCI Hotel has also become a preferred choice for families traveling with children.
The hotel recognizes the importance of maintaining routines, especially when jetlag
and unfamiliar environments are in play. To cater to these needs, the hotel offers
a gym for daily exercise, a cafe for coffee cravings and sweets, and a delightful
swimming pool to keep the kids entertainedâ€”all conveniently located within the hotel's
premises.
